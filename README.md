Scaled Dot-Product Attention from Scratch using NumPy
# Scaled Dot-Product Attention from Scratch (NumPy)

Why This Project Matters

Modern NLP models such as Transformers, BERT, and GPT rely heavily on attention mechanisms.
This project shows that I understand how attention works internally, not just how to call library APIs.

Key focus areas:

Mathematical formulation of attention

Efficient matrix computations

Batch processing

Mask handling

Interpretability via visualization

🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

Scaled Dot-Product Attention

Softmax normalization with numerical stability

Attention masking (padding support)

Batched tensor operations

Model interpretability through heatmaps
